# Phase-3-Project
# Monkey_pox_prediction
## Description
As more cases of monkeypox emerge, the world becomes increasingly concerned, as they do not want a repeat of what happened not too long ago, when the infamous Covid-19 broke out and altered the world as we know it. Faced with the reality that such viral diseases can actually shut down the planet, the organisation must develop ways to reduce the spread of this disease, regardless of how quickly the virus can be transferred and, worse, mutate into a more lethal variant.
